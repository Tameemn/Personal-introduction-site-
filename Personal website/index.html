            <h3>Audi technician</h3>
            <p class="P-audi">An Audi accredited technician with over 4 years of experience. Carrying out a variety of tasks from basic repairs to diagnosing and trouble shooting faults. Through my experience and my time at audi I developed great problem solving skills aswell as time management, placed in situations where working efficiently to diagnose vehicle faults was essential, to meet customer needs and overall business satisfaction. This accustomed me to working under high pressure situations. When issues were raised and remedies were found it was then vital for that information to be passed on clearly to the right colleagues within the team, this created many opportunities for me to excel withing my communication skills as well being an effective team player.</p>
