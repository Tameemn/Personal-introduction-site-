# Personal-introduction-site- Html and CSS 
After learning and using Html, I swiftly leanrnt CSS. If Html is the walls of a house. CSS would be the wallpaper and decoration. Starting of with I firstly learnt how to directly change html elememnts such as headers and manipulated them using CSS and changing things such as font and font size. Another important thing learnt was add classes to elements and naming them. This was very useful as i could manipulate and edit each element individually, and allow me to have variety within my webpage. One important thing I also covered was box model design. There were a few images on the page that needed adjusting and did by changing the position to absolute and adjusting the amount of pixels it was from each border.
